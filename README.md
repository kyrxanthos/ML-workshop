# Python & Machine Learning Workshop

In this tutorial, we will be introducing the basics of Python and Machine Learning. This tutorial is intended for high school students who are new to programming and machine learning. We will cover the following topics:

- Simple Python Functions
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Functions in Python

We then include 5 exercises that assess what we learned from the above topics 

Later we will look at some Machine Learning high-level concepts (teasers). We will explore a case study that has to do with heart failure and we will include 8 optional exercises for anyone who wants to build their first Machine Learning model!

## Repository Navigation

Please note the actual tutorial is the `ML_workshop_students.ipynb` file. For the solutions to the exercises, refer to `python_ML_workshop.ipynb`. 

## Setup

We recommend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) for running the tutorial. The students should be able to login to their Google account and open the jupyter notebook through Github. Note that if you are connected to school or work networks google collab might not be able to work with [www.github.com](https://github.com). In that case we suggest downloading the repository as a zip file and distirbuting it to the students. 

## Data Availability

We use the [Heart Failure Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records) by UCI. An edited version is included in the repository under the name [heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset1.csv](https://github.com/kyrxanthos/ML-workshop/blob/main/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset1.csv).
